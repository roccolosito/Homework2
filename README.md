# My Personal Webpage

Welcome to my webpage. It consists of 4 (four) main pages: Home, About, Portfolio, and Contact.
The Homepage is the first page the user sees--it has my picture and a simple greeting. The About page has a paragraph outlining some of my experience, education and background. The Portfolio page showcases some of my selected app projects that I've worked on. And finally, the
Contact page gives a form allowing folks to send me a direct message if interested. Thanks.

It utilizes HTML5, Bootstrap, Javascript, Google Fonts, Font Awesome, and CSS.

Here is a link to the deployed site: https://roccolosito.github.io/responsivePortfolio/
